# Cartpole Balancing using Reinforcement Learning
 
- A ROS node was created that implements a learning algorithm to control this robot to balance the pole.
- OpenAI gym environment of cartpole system is imported to ROS visualization GUI.
- Reinforcement Learning algorithm Deep Q-learning with experience replay is used to solve the cartpole problem.
- The cartpole was balanced for 500 steps after proper training of the Deep-Q Neural Network
